# Tutorial to install and practice JS with Webpack

This tuto follow Webpack original documentation:
[Webpack Basic Setup](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)

## 1 Stting up the folder

```
$ mkdir webpack-demo
$ cd webpack-demo
```
## 2 Initializing Node and installing Webpack

In the terminal run :
```
$ npm init -y
$ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Create the following directory structure:
```
  webpack-demo
  |- package.json
  |- /dist
    |- index.html
  |- /src
    |- index.js
```

## 3 Creating a Bundle:

To bundle the lodash dependency with index.js, we'll need to install the library locally:
```
$ npm install --save lodash
```
Bundle the dependency:
```
$ npx webpack
```

## 4 Advanced Webpack configuration:

Add ``webpack.config.js`` to the ``root``
Ã€t this point the dir structure should be like that:
```
  webpack-demo
  |- package.json
  |- webpack.config.js
  |- /dist
    |- index.html
    |- main.js
  |- /src
    |- index.js
```

In ``./webpack.config.js`` add config code:
```
  const path = require('path');

  module.exports = {
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
      filename: 'main.js',
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
  };
```
In the terminal bundle with:
```
$ npx webpack --config webpack.config.js 
```
