Creating a Bundle:
To bundle the lodash dependency with index.js, we'll need to install the library locally:
$ npm install --save lodash

bundle the dependency
$ npx webpack

Advanced Webpack configuration

add webpack.config.js to the root
at thsi point the dir structure should be like that:

  webpack-demo
  |- package.json
  |- webpack.config.js
  |- /dist
    |- index.html
    |- main.js
  |- /src
    |- index.js

copy in webpack.config.js the folowing code:


const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};

run:
$ npx webpack --config webpack.config.js
